Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
    I consulted with Hanna Wheeler and Tanisha Chetty. I also talked to Miriam Pennock, who took the class last semester. 

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
    I was planning to go to TA hours on Sunday the 16th, but the student run org that I'm on the board of had an emergency meeting and I was not able to attend. 

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
    I think there's some weird words that mean very specific things but I definitely feel like it's starting to make sense. There are definitely some simple commands that I'm getting the hang of, but then I feel like as soon as I try to add something new in it doesn't make sense anymore. 

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
    It feels like Java can have more different applications because it is object oriented. I don't really remember a lot about Python so I'm having a hard time thinking about the similarities and differences and how they would affect programming in general. I am really curious how the two languages might have different applications. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    The advice that I would give is not to wait to start assignments. I also started looking at at the "Think Java" pdf towards the end of working on this, and it seems like it could be really helpful, so I definitely want to look at it more and use it in the future. Trying to work on this on my own didn't really work, but working with classmates was a lot more helpful.
